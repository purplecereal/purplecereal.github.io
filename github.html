						<h2 style="padding-bottom: 20%;padding-top: 20%;"> 5 ways to speed up your website</h2>



						<img src="Entprn.jpg" height="20%" width="60%" style="padding-top: 10%;padding-bottom: 10%;">



														<p>As average internet connection speeds increase around the world and mobile use
														dominates, web users are becoming less and less tolerant of slow load times. 53% of
														mobile users will abandon a website that takes longer than three seconds to load, and
														nearly 10% of web users will bounce after 2 seconds. Clearly, every second counts.
														At the same time, Google has stated unequivocally that page speed is a ranking factor in
														search results.

														In short, a fast site gets better results both from visitors and Google. To take advantage of
														these dual benefits, you need to make site speed a priority on your site. Any of the
														following five tips will help to get you started on this important path.
														What You'll Learn... </p>






														 <ul>
														<li>1. Optimize Your Images.<li>
														<li>Step 1: Re-size your images before uploading them.<li>
														<li>Step 2: Compress your images.</li>
														<li>2. Ensure Your Site Scripts Are Up to Date.</li>
														<li>3. Enable Browser Caching.</li>
														<li>4. Keep Plugins Up to Date.</li>
														<li>5. Upgrade Your Web Hosting.</li>
													</ul>








												 <h2><b>Optimize Your Images</b></h2>
<p>Every time someone visits a page on your website, their browser has to load every part of
the page. On many pages, the parts that take up the most space and therefore take the
longest time to load are the images. One of the best and easiest ways to get your pages loading faster is therefore to optimize your images.<br></p>







<h4><b>Step 1:         Re-size your images before uploading them.</b></h4>
<p>If you use a content management system (CMS) like WordPress or Joomla, you’ve probably
noticed that you can upload images at full size and then adjust their display size within your
website’s backend.
That’s convenient, but you may not know that doing so forces web browsers to execute
multiple commands each time someone loads the page. They must pull up the initial image
and then re-size it on the fly – which slows down your site.
To prevent this from occurring, use an image-editing program to adjust images to the
correct size yourself before adding them to your site.
Most of us will have access to a simple tool like Preview (on Mac) or Microsoft Paint (on
Windows). With these programs all you have to do is open up the image and re-size it in
your editor of choice.</p>






<h4><b>Step 2:           Compress your images.</b></h4>
<p>Once you’ve done this you can take your image editing to the next level with a compression
tool. Even after re-sizing an image the total file size could be large enough to still slow
down your site’s loading speed.
One of the best image compression tools available is ImageResize. All you have to do is
click the link, upload your re-sized image and this tool will reduce the file size without
reducing the resolution.
Then, all you have to do is download the image and upload it to your site. Your images will
look exactly the same, but will load much faster.</p>






<h2><b>Ensure Your Site Scripts Are Up to Date</b></h2>
<p>Depending on the CMS or e-commerce platform your site uses, you may need to check
back regularly to determine whether new releases of your site’s scripts are available.
If they are, upgrade your site as soon as possible (making sure that you have a current
backup file in place first). Site script developers are always working on improving their
code for future releases, particularly when it comes to site speed. Updating your scripts to
the latest versions could go a long way toward eliminating coded roadblocks that prevent
your site from loading quickly.
If your site runs on WordPress, then you’ll find these updates within the Updates tab of your
WordPress dashboard. Just one click and your site will install the latest software updates.
No need for anything else on your end.
Admittedly, remembering to check-in and update your website can be tough. Lucky for you
this isn’t something you have to do on a daily basis. Once a month is enough to do a simple
run-through of your site and install any updates that might be available.
Set a recurring event on your calendar and set aside an hour every single month. Usually,
it’ll take much less time than this, but it’s important to build the habit of always ensuring
your site and plugins are running the latest version.
Plus, having all of your software up to date will help to patch up any holes that could lead
to your site being hacked.</p>





<h2><b>Enable Browser Caching</b></h2>
<p>Browser caching is a technology that allows a visitor’s browser to store copies of your site’s
individual pages so that when the visitor returns in the future, the content can be called up
from within the cache rather than reloading the entire page.
This saves the number of resources used to display your pages, resulting in faster overall
load times for your visitor.
If you use WordPress, you can easily enable browser caching with a plug-in like W3 Total
Cache. To install this plugin on your WordPress site, follow the steps below:</p>

<p>1 Navigate to your site’s Dashboard, then Plugins>Add New, and search for W3 Total Cache. Click
Install, then Activate.</p>

<p>2 Once the plugin is activated, navigate to the new Performance tab at the top or lefthand side. This
is where you’ll control all of the features of the plugin.</p>

<p>3 There are a ton of features that you can turn on or off with this plugin. If you want to fully
configure this plugin, then check out this post by WPMU DEV.</p>
<p>Alternatively, talk to your web developer about ways to integrate browser caching into your
server-side scripting.</p>






<h2><b>Keep Plugins Up to Date.</b></h2>
<p>Plugins like Yoast and Jetpack are fantastic for learning more about your visitors. However, older versions of plugins don’t always interact
well with your website.
Updated plugins may feature refined code. The less code your website has to parse through in order to load, the faster visitors can browse
your site.</p>







<h2><b>Upgrade Your Web Hosting.</b></h2>
<p>When starting out, you probably selected the cheapest hosting option for your website.
That’s normal and usually works well enough for a new website while you’re starting to
build visibility and traffic.
As your marketing efforts start to pay off and your traffic increases, your hosting needs
change. If your website traffic has increased considerably and you haven’t upgraded your
hosting plan to match, that’s likely to cause slow or spotty performance issues.
Going from shared hosting to cloud hosting, or from shared to a VPS, can make a huge
difference to how quickly your website loads for visitors.
Check with your web hosting provider to see if it’s time to upgrade, or consider if it might
be time to switch to a new provider. HostGator’s known for having a 99.9% uptime
guarantee and has representatives that will answer any questions you have about selecting
the right web hosting plan to keep your website fast and functional.</p>






<p>Although these are only a few of the different techniques that can be used to speed up
your site, they’re some of the easiest to implement. This list is a great place to start if you
notice your site slowing down. When every second counts, every step you can take for a
faster website is worth it.The importance of page speed is only going to increase in the coming years.
So take these tips on how to make web pages load faster and use them to improve your website.</p>
